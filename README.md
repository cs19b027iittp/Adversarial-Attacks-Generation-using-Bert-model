# Adversarial-Attacks-Generation-using-Bert-model


This project is about text paraphrase methods. Text paraphrasing has several applications such as adversarial attack and style transfer.
We use a universal sentence encoder to evaluate the semantic similarity between original and paraphrased text. We also train a BERT classifier on the original dataset, and check of paraphrased sentences can break the text classifier. We build a bert classifier which is trained upon datasets imported. Adversarial examples are generated on the model to fool the clsssifer.
